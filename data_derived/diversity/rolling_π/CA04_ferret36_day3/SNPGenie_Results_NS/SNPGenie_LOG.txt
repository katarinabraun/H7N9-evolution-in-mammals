temp_vcf4_CA04_ferret36_day3.vcf	NA	521	Variant data at this site imply a negative number of T nucleotides: -18818. This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. Results at this site are unreliable; T count set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_CA04_ferret36_day3.vcf	NA	521	Variant data at this site imply a negative proportion of T nucleotides of -0.749034749034749. This may result from rounding error, in which case the number will be very small in magnitude, or variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. If the latter, results at this site are unreliable. In either case, T prop has set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_CA04_ferret36_day3.vcf	NA	521	Coverage (25123.000) does not equal the nucleotide sum (43941.000).
temp_vcf4_CA04_ferret36_day3.vcf	NEP	521	Variant data at this site imply a negative number of T nucleotides: -4171. This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. Results at this site are unreliable; T count set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_CA04_ferret36_day3.vcf	NEP	521	Variant data at this site imply a negative proportion of T nucleotides of -0.166023166023166. This may result from rounding error, in which case the number will be very small in magnitude, or variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. If the latter, results at this site are unreliable. In either case, T prop has set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_CA04_ferret36_day3.vcf	NEP	521	Nucleotide total does not equal 100.00% of coverage, but instead 116.60%. This should occur only when conflicting coverages have been reported
temp_vcf4_CA04_ferret36_day3.vcf	NS1	521	Variant data at this site imply a negative number of T nucleotides: -4171. This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report. Results at this site are unreliable; T count set to 0; proceed with caution.

temp_vcf4_CA04_ferret36_day3.vcf	NS1	520	Nucleotide total does not equal 100.00% of coverage, but instead 116.60%. This should occur only when conflicting coverages have been reported
